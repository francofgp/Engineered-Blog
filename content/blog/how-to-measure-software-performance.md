## How to remain competitive?

To remain competitive and excel in the market, organizations must
accelerate:

- Delivery of goods and services to delight their customers
- Engagement with the market to detect and understand customer demand
- Anticipation of compliance and regulatory changes that impact their systems
- response to potential risks such as security threats or changes in the economy.
  
> At the heart of this acceleration is software

## DevOps comes to play

Software is transforming and accelerating organizations of all kinds.
The practices and capabilities give rise to what is known as  the **DevOps movement**, and they are transforming industries
everywhere.

DevOps emerged from a small number of organizations facing a
wicked problem: how to build secure, resilient, rapidly evolving distributed
systems at scale.

## Why focus on capabilities and not maturity?

Technology leaders need to deliver software quickly and reliably to win in the
market. For many companies, this requires significant changes to the way we
deliver software. The key to successful change is measuring and understanding
the right things with a focus on capabilities—not on maturity.

Shifting to a capabilities model of measurement is essential for
organizations wanting to accelerate software delivery. This is due to **four
factors**.

| Maturity Models      | Capabilities Models|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus on helping an organization **arrive** at a mature state and then declare themselves done with their journey, whereas technology transformations should follow a continuous improvement paradigm.      | Capability models focus on helping an organization continually improve and progress, realizing that the technological and business landscape is ever-changing.      |
| They are quite often a **lock-step** or linear formula, prescribing a similar set of technologies, tooling, or capabilities for every set of teams and organizations to progress through.   | Capability models are multidimensional and dynamic, allowing different parts of the organization to take a customized approach to improvement, and focus on capabilities that will give them the most benefit based on their current context and their short and long-term goals.        |
|They are output based| They are outcome based|
|Define a static level of technological, process, and organizational abilities to achieve.|capability models allow for dynamically changing environments and allow teams and organizations to focus on developing the skills and capabilities needed to remain competitive.|

Third, capability models focus on key outcomes and how the capabilities, or
levers, drive improvement in those outcomes—that is, they are outcome based

*By focusing on a capabilities paradigm, organizations can continuously
drive improvement. And by focusing on the right capabilities, organizations can
drive improvements in their outcomes*

## Which factors do not predict performance?

- age and technology used for the application
- whether operations teams or development teams performed deployments
- whether a change approval board (CAB) is implemented

The things that do make a difference in the success of software delivery and
organizational performance are those that the highest performers and most
innovative companies use to get ahead. Our research has identified 24 key
capabilities that drive improvement in software delivery performance and, in
turn, organizational performance. These capabilities are easy to define,
measure, and improve.

## The value of DevOps

Some of the advantages of adopting DevOps lead to:

- Increased frequency of deployment
- Faster lead time form commit to deploy
- Faster mean time ti recover from dowtime
- Decreased change failure rate
