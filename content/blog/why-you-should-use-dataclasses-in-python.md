Today you are going to learn how to create this amazing figures in Python. More precisely, you will learn what the Dragon Curve is, how to generate one, and how to create one in Python.

## What are Data Classes?

Dataclasses are like normal classes, but designed to store data, rather than contain a lot of logic.
When you create a class that mostly consists of attributes, you make a data class.
An example of a typical dataclass can be seen below ðŸ‘‡

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ChemicalElement:
    '''Class that represents a chemical element'''
    name: str
    symbol: str
    weight: float
    atomic_number: int 
```
To use a Data Class, we need to use the `dataclasses` module that was introduces in Python 3.7, this module  make it easier to create data classes.
It takes care of a lot of boilerplate for you.
These classes hold certain properties and functions to deal specifically with the data and its representation.

## What is the difference with a regular class?

The Data class presented above can be written using a normal python class, as follows:

```python
class ChemicalElementNormalClass:
    '''A normal python class that represents a chemical element'''
    def __init__(self, name, symbol, weight, atomic_number):
        self.name = name
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.weight = weight
        self.atomic_number = atomic_number
```


The DataClasses are implemented by using decorators with classes. Attributes are declared using Type Hints in Python which is essentially, specifying data type for variables in python.

## Conclusion

Something that at first glance seemed frightening turned out to be simple, by breaking up step by step we have learned how to create this amazing fractal in Python easily.

This doesn't have to end up here, go ahead and experiment, change the color, the speed, or alter the direction of the dragon curve, and share what you've discovered to me or to the community.
